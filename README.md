Scrub Order Final
Created by Lindsay Munns

Program creates Student objects with attributes for gender, top size, top quantity, pant size, pant length, and pant quantity. Each Student object is stored in a list, students, that is totaled automatically after there are no more orders to add. The individual items (e.g. women's shirt size medium) are totaled in all the students and printed to the terminal if the quantity is greater than 0.
